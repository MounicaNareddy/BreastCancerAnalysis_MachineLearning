# BreastCancerAnalysis_MachineLearning
Designed a classification model to predict whether the cancer is Benign or Malignant so that the doctor can take appropriate care of the patient. Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It then aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object. I have chosen this model for this data set because it provides more accuracy when compared to other Machine Learning models.
